# Gruber darker
A Windows Terminal version of the Gruber Darker color scheme based on the color themes for Emacs by Jason Blevins, for BBEdit by John Gruber and for deftheme by Alexey Kutepov a.k.a. rexim.

## Usage
Currently you have to manually paste the [json](gruber-darker-color-scheme.json) into your settings.json of Windows Terminal because no import feature exists.
